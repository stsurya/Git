## Git Commands

**git init:** It'll intialize any empty git repository on your local with your branch name as `master`.

Note: Incase if your local got initialized with master branch and remote got intialized with main, use this command `git branch -m master main`. this command will move all your code from existing master branch to main branch.

**git add <filename>:** It'll add a file to your staging area.
